# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was created as part of a challenge for Talent Squad (Barcelona Digital Talent).
From a Figma design, I developed a payment form with field and format validation.

## Techstack

- ReactJS: "^18.2.0",
- TypescriptJS: "^4.8.4"
- react-bootstrap: "^2.5.0"

## To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
